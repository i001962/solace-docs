# Earn Rewards

The most attractive part for any capital provider is to get rewarded, here you go:

1. Open the Solace Dashboard and click on the Invest tab. 

2. Click on Deposit in Solace Capital Provider Farm and enter the amount of CP tokens you want to deposit. Probably, you can click on “Max”.

3. Confirm the transaction and start to generate call options!

When it’s time to benefit from your contribution and claim rewards, follow the next steps: 

1. Open the Solace Dashboard and click on the “Claim” next to your rewards balance. 

This will mint a Call Option token (NFT) that grants you the right to buy SOLACE.

2. Now you see a button, which will create a transaction for you to pay ETH in return for SOLACE. 

Exercise it and buy SOLACE at strike price (0.03$). 

You did it In private round investors style! 

Note:
— Rewards amount is the amount of SOLACE you'll get. 
— You’ll have a month after the time you claim the option to exercise it.


Few months later we will transit to Liquidity Farm so you can benefit from premium flow.
