2. Click on Deposit in ETH Risk backing Capital Pool and enter the amount of ETH you want to invest. 

3. Confirm the transaction and receive your Solace CP tokens in your wallet! Now you become a risk underwriter and  you can earn a reward.

You can see all information about your position in the Invest tab: Your assets, Total assets, ROI and Your Vault Share.
