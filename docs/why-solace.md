# Why Solace?

Currently, there are no coverage options that implement a structure that is efficient, secure and intelligent offering for millions of retail users and institutional players. DeFi remains a risky space, which hinders the growth and prevents crypto applications in becoming a real alternative for TradFi.

Solace is focused on providing this advantageous model. Coverage protection should also be fast and efficient. Solace does not require KYC and uses a single efficient capital pool. All of our peers employ people to determine risk and loss, which takes time and is prone to human error. We use quantitative and qualitative modeling that results in intelligent risk assessment, which is faster and more efficient. Users can query for loss at any time and for no fee, differentiating from providers that charge a fee and have a turnaround time for human review, which may take up to 35 days. All of these factors combined reduce our overhead cost, allowing for lower rates and higher returns than our peers. An added bonus is that we're 40% more gas efficient in policy creation which means that 40% more ETH stays in Solace user’s wallets.

At the core of who we are and what we do is our community. Solace is a user-oriented protocol. Any well-architected coverage product must be reliable and provide resilience to the ecosystem. Solace is going beyond that.

To achieve this Solace focuses on 3 major points: 

**- Auto Claims Processing**: Solace enables filing a claim and getting paid in a single transaction, as our aim is to make this a hassle-free process. We created this experience by focusing on how as users we would want to secure our investment, and in the event of a loss how to recover that loss.

**- Intelligent Risk Assessment**: Solace manages risk and liability exposure in the most accurate and sophisticated way possible. Our risk management does not rely on human voting or market bias, but quantitative (statistics, probability, etc.) and qualitative (e.g., audits) measures.

**- High Capital Efficiency**: We aim to provide coverage in the most secure and cost effective manner possible. Solace uses Protocol’s owned capital to pool the risk across all of its products, which ultimately translates to affordable premiums for the user.
