# Why Solace?

Why Solace? Well that's easy. It's because we offer a number of advantages over the competition that results in a better experience, better coverage, lower rates, is more efficient and yields higher returns. 

Because we focus first on providing coverage as opposed to prioritizing raising capital and farming, this allows us to deliver the best user experience and value possible while ensuring that coverage and protecting user’s funds. 

Coverage protection should also be fast and efficient. Solace does not require KYC and uses a single efficient capital pool. All of our peers employ people to determine risk and loss, which takes time and is prone to human error. We use quantitative and qualitative modeling that results in intelligent risk assessment, which is faster and more efficient. Users can query for loss at any time and for no fee, differentiating from providers that charge a fee and have a turnaround time for human review, which may take up to 35 days. All of these factors combined reduce our overhead cost, allowing for lower rates and higher returns than our peers. An added bonus is that we're 40% more gas efficient in policy creation which means that 40% more ETH stays in Solace user’s wallets.

At the core of who we are and what we do is our community. Solace is a user-oriented protocol. Any well-architected coverage product must be reliable and provide resilience to the ecosystem. Solace is going beyond that. Most empowering and impactful tools are simple and elegant, so, as a community, we strive to deliver a user experience that you’re excited about. Not because you feel like a genius degen executing a complex convoluted yield farming strategy, but because it doesn’t take any effort or time to protect your funds. Now you can watch your tokens go to the moon.

To achieve this Solace focuses on 3 major points: 

**- Auto Claims Processing**: We know that, as a user, you want to file a claim and get paid in a hassle-free fashion. Solace let's you file a claim and get paid in a single transaction, because we value your time and funds.

**- Intelligent Risk Assessment**: As a protocol, Solace manages the risk and liability exposures in the most accurate way possible. Risk management doesn't rely on human voting or market bias, but quantitative (statistics, probability, etc.) and qualitative (e.g., audits) measures.

**- High Capital Efficiency**: We want you to get covered in the most secure way possible, without breaking a bank. Solace pools the risk across all of its products, which ultimately translates to affordable premiums for the user and greater returns for the underwriter.f
