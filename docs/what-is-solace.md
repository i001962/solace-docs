# What is Solace?

The idea behind Solace was envisioned because of the need to make the DeFi space more safe, secure and trusted. With that goal in mind, our protocol was built to enable millions of users to onboard,  de-risk DeFi and become a viable alternative to TradFi. Our coverage policies can protect liquidity providers, Defi protocols or DAOs to mitigate loss from hacks, bugs and exploits. However, Solace is not about insurance or coverage products. Solace, first and foremost, is a community behind the protocol aiming at providing safety and confidence in a way that is accessible, simple, and transparent to everyone across the world.


## How to interact with Solace:

Despite how powerful the Solace protocol is, getting coverage is an easy and simple experience. 

**- Buy Coverage**: Invest in DeFi, get coverage, and sleep well while your money is working for you.

**- Underwrite the Risk**: Provide your ETH to the Underwriting Pool and generate returns on your capital.

**- Become a Risk Manager**: Develop risk assessment models and earn a fee as people buy coverage.

## Protocols & DAOs

**- Buy or provide coverage for liquidity pool(s) or your treasury**: Protect your usersâ€™ funds from any technical shortfall event.

**- Integrate Solace natively into your protocol or front-end interface**: Give the users an option to get covered by Solace while interacting with your platform.
