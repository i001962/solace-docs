# What is Solace?

Blockchain is a revolutionary technology that has a great chance to change the world. The digital asset space is a fast paced environment and there is uncertainty associated with using these new applications. Like most revolutions, it can be messy and risky to navigate.

Solace is building a community around making this space safe, secure and trusted so that we can onboard and de-risk DeFi and other crypto applications while opening the space to millions of users. We recently launched a coverage policy protocol that enables protection for liquidity providers, Defi protocols or DAOs to mitigate loss from hacks, bugs and exploits. Our purpose is to transform DeFi by delivering intelligent and empowering tools for a safe, secure and trusted industry. 

## How to interact with Solace:

Despite the powerful impact, getting coverage with the Solace protocol is an easy and simple experience.

**- Buy Coverage**: Invest in DeFi, get coverage, and sleep well while your money is working for you.

**- Bond Assets**: Buy $SOLACE through bonding at a discount, while Solace users receive assets for the underwriting activity they participate in.

**- Stake $SOLACE**: Buy $SOLACE through bonding or on the open market and stake it to earn yield from protocol revenue and to unlock governance rights.

**- Become a Risk Manager**: Develop risk assessment models and earn a fee as people buy coverage.

## Protocols & DAOs

**- Buy or provide coverage for liquidity pool(s) or your treasury**: Protect your usersâ€™ funds from any technical shortfall event.

**- Integrate Solace natively into your protocol or front-end interface**: Give the users an option to get covered by Solace while interacting with your platform.
