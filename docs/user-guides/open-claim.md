# Open Claim

If something bad happened to protocol where you have deposited funds and you want to open the claim, here's how you do it:

1. Open the Solace Dashboard and choose a position that suffered from failure and click the “Claim” button. Now Solace starts to evaluate your loss and shows the amount to you.

2. Click the “Submit claim” button.

 Note that payout stays in Escrow for one week as a cooldown period. Solace or anyone else does not have access to funds at that time.
