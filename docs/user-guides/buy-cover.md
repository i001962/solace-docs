# Buy Cover

A guide to buying coverage.

To learn how to obtain payout after buying coverage, please refer to [**Make a Claim**](make-a-claim).

#### Step 0: Have existing liquidity positions with other protocols

- ##### After connecting your wallet, navigate to the **Buy Cover** page. There will be a 4-step form for you to navigate through.

#### Step 1: Choose the protocol that you would like to get covered
  
- ##### You can see the yearly cost and the available coverage for each protocol.
- ##### After selecting a protocol, you are automatically taken to the next step.

#### Step 2: Choose the position that you would like to get covered

- ##### You can see your positions from your deposits on the selected protocol.
- ##### After selecting a position, you are automatically taken to the next step.
- ##### If you want to change your selected protocol, click the button on the **Protocol Display Box**.

#### Step 3: Choose the amount you would like to get covered and the length of coverage

- ##### You can see your position denominated in ETH. This amount will be used for the subsequent sections of this step.
