# Buy Coverage

If you think that it would be nice to feel safe about your funds, here you go then:

1. Firstly you have to deposit funds on one of the protocols that Solace provides coverage for, so we can detect your positions.

2. Then you open Solace.fi and connect your wallet. Just like on any other protocol app. Remember, you need to select a wallet that has LP tokens you want to protect.

3. Click on the “Buy coverage” button and choose the protocol where you want to get coverage. 

4. Choose the position you would like to get covered and adjust the amount of your position and the length of coverage.

    Note
    - Maximum coverage period is 365 days, but you can always extend it after purchase
    - The amount cannot exceed your position or Solace's maximum coverage per user, but you may change the covered amount after purchase


5. Click the “Buy coverage” button. Now you get protected and you won’t suffer from loss of money!
