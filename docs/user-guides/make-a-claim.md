# Make a Claim

A guide to making a claim for a policy.

If you hold a policy for your position during a loss event, that is if an amount of your position is lost for whatever reason, you may submit a claim to get reimbursed the amount that you have lost, as long as it can be covered by your policy.

To start, navigate to the Dashboard and follow the instructions below.

#### Step 1: Select an active policy

- ##### Click the **Claim** button, then a popup will appear.
- ##### Please wait for the app to finish evaluating your loss.

#### Step 2: Confirm the amount that you will be receiving for your coverage.

#### Step 3: Click the **Submit Claim** button

- ##### Please note that you **cannnot withdraw your reimbursement** until the cooldown period has elapsed from the time of your submission.

After submitting for a claim during a loss event, you should see the new claim on your Dashboard.
