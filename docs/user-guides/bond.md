# How To Bond

To buy $SOLACE through bonding you should follow the next steps:

**2.** Choose the asset you want to bond and click on button 'Bond'
**3.** Sign an approval that Solace can use your tokens for bonding
**4.** Enter the amount of tokens you want to bond and click 'Bond'. 

You can also choose to autostake your SOLACE after vesting to receive xSOLACE and earn rewards from Protocolâ€™s activities and token distribution.

The price begins at $0.10/SOLACE, increases by $0.01/SOLACE for every 50,000 SOLACE bonded, and decreases over time until a new bond is purchased.

To redeem your SOLACE tokens, follow these steps:

**1.** Open https://solace.fi/ and go to 'Bonds'.
**2.** Choose the asset you have bonded and click on button 'Bond'.
**3.** Choose 'Redeem', enter the amount of tokens and click 'Claim'.

Remember, that bonds will be vested over five days, so you can redeem tokens only after vesting period.
