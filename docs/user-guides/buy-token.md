# Buy Token

There are 2 ways to buy $SOLACE: you can buy it on the open market or through bonding with a discount.

To buy tokens through bonding with a discount you should go on https://solace.fi/. You can bond ETH, WBTC, USDC, DAI, USDT, SCP, and SOLACE-USDC SLP. You can go to the “How to bond” page to see step-by-step instructions.

If you see negative ROI for bonds, it would be cheaper for you to buy it on the open market. You can do that on SushiSwap, SOLACE-USDC pool.
