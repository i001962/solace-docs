# Underwrite Risk

It is a good idea to make more money with your ETH. And itâ€™s a good option to underwrite the risk and generate rewards. Here how you can do it:

1. Open the Solace Dashboard and click on the Invest tab. So now you see 2 pools: Risk backing Capital Pool and Capital Provider Farm.

2. Click on Deposit in ETH Risk backing Capital Pool and enter the amount of ETH you want to invest. 

3. Confirm the transaction and receive your Solace CP tokens in your wallet! Now you become a risk underwriter and  you can earn a reward.

You can see all information about your position in the Invest tab: Your assets, Total assets, ROI and Your Vault Share.
