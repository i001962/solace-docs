# Earn Rewards

A guide to earning returns from Solace.

## Step 1: Provide Capital or Liquidity

Users are incentivized in exchange for providing funds and liquidity to the Solace Protocol. The form of the rewards will be SOLACE tokens, which user can lock up for voting power or keep for other plans in mind. Please refer to the [**Becoming a Liquidity Provider**](liquidity-provider/lp-role-guide) or [**Becoming a Capital Provider**](capital-provider/cp-role-guide) for more information.

## Step 2: Go to the Dashboard, Invest, or Govern page.

View the blue **User Data Display Box** near the top of the page.

Click the **Claim** button to claim the rewards that you have earned from the Capital Provider Pool and/or the Liquidity Provider Pool. This button is disabled if there is no reward to claim.
