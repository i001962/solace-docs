## About DeFi

In recent years, the amount of activity in decentralized finance (DeFi) had skyrocketed, which makes it clear that the space is rapidly growing. To support such a lively ecosystem, there is a need for tools and services that didn't exist before. One problem that rose from this unsatisfied need is the financial losses of protocols and users, conducted by adversarial behavior and erroneous code. The protocols and users should be protected from these losses, and so follows the emergence of the insurance protocol market.

## So Why Solace?

Solace is a user-oriented insurance protocol. While every insurance protocol has to be secure, provide the lowest possible price, variety of products and the greatest risk-backing capital pool, Solace are going beyond that in an effort to provide truly decentralised, comfortable and trustless-based user experience.

To achieve this, Solace optimizes its operations through automation to significantly improve its agility, It manages risk through Solace's inter-nodal matrix (INM) based on ML models, provides automated claims assessment excluding human participation and balances risk across its portfolio and therefore can provide more active coverages for users.

## Observed Comparisons with Other Known Insurance Protocols

Solace is one of the decentralized multi-chain insurance protocols that exist today in the DeFi space, yet it has a number of perks in the way it operates and handles coverage compared to other protocols:

| Protocol | Risk Management | KYC | Considerations |
| :--- |  :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Solace | Does not rely on voting for assessing risk, instead it uses probabilistic models | No | Automatic claims assessment along with immediate validation and payout. Covers liquidity positions in different protocols. High capital efficiency.
| Nexus Mutual | Community voting through staked tokens | Yes | Community voting improperly prices risk for protocols |
| Cover | Prediction market solution, claims validated by committee | No | Market voting does not accurately capture the risk. Claims processed by committees are slow and could be biased. Low capital efficiency. |
| Opyn | Financial derivative (options) solutions | No | Does not cover liquidity positions in protocols, only price action for an asset. Currently only available for UNI. |
