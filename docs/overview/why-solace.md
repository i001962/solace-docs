## About DeFi

In recent years, the amount of activity in decentralized finance (DeFi) had skyrocketed, which makes it clear that the space is rapidly growing. To support such a lively ecosystem, there is a need for tools and services that didn't exist before. One problem that rose from this unsatisfied need is the financial losses of protocols and users, conducted by adversarial behavior and erroneous code. The protocols and users should be protected from these losses, and so follows the emergence of the insurance protocol market.

## Observed Comparisons with Other Known Insurance Protocols

Solace is one of the decentralized multi-chain insurance protocols that exist today in the DeFi space, yet it has a number of perks in the way it operates and handles coverage compared to other protocols:

| Protocol | Risk Management | KYC | Considerations |
| :--- |  :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Solace | Does not rely on voting for assessing risk, instead it uses probabilistic models | No | Automatic claims assessment along with immediate validation and payout. Covers liquidity positions in different protocols. High capital efficiency.
| Nexus Mutual | Community voting through staked tokens | Yes | Community voting improperly prices risk for protocols |
| Cover | Prediction market solution, claims validated by committee | No | Market voting does not accurately capture the risk. Claims processed by committees are slow and could be biased. Low capital efficiency. |
| Opyn | Financial derivative (options) solutions | No | Does not cover liquidity positions in protocols, only price action for an asset. Currently only available for UNI. |
