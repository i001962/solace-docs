## About DeFi

In recent years, the amount of activity in decentralized finance (DeFi) had skyrocketed, which makes it clear that the space is rapidly growing. To support such a lively ecosystem, there is a need for tools and services that didn't exist before. One problem that rose from this unsatisfied need is the financial losses of protocols and users, conducted by adversarial behavior and erroneous code. The protocols and users should be protected from these losses, and so follows the emergence of the insurance protocol market.

## Why Solace?

Solace is one of the decentralized multi-chain insurance protocols that exist today in the DeFi space, yet it has a number of perks in the way it operates and handles coverage:

- Solace does not rely on voting for assessing risk, instead it uses probabilistic models

- Automatic claims assessment along with immediate validation and payout

- Covers liquidity positions in different protocols

- High capital efficiency
