# Product Design

Solace protocol is designed as a mechanism to protect users from inherent risks associated with DeFi products. In order to achieve efficient and long-term protocol performance and provide the most secure, stable and convenient product to the market, we focused on the following aspects:

## Risk Management

- Risk managed through Solace's inter-nodal matrix (INM). Find out more details on page Risk Assessment
- Does not rely on voting or staking to determine the risk of an existing DeFi Platform (i.e., leverages market data)

## Claim Assessment

- Parametric automatic claims assessment system, known as PACLAS, monitors data for exploits and assesses financial losses in real-time
- Claim validation drives immediate payout, Solace does not assess claims through committees, votes, or other human processes that may take days or weeks.

## Optimised Exposure

- Provides cover to existing and verifiable DeFi positions
- Solace only pays out financial loss and not the overall position covered by end customer
- Reduces overall risk for Solace and enables platform to grow through smaller investments in newer protocols while balancing risk across its entire portfolio
