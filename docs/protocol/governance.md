# Governance

Solace governance is a decentralized process that directs the protocol, defines incentives, develops new products, assesses risk, updates system components, and
provides coverage for the protocol in case of an incident.

## Vote-escrowed SOLACE token (veSOLACE)

Individuals who lock their SOLACE tokens will earn a stable return (flat-rate plus a portion of revenue from the premiums) in SOLACE tokens and gain voting rights after a delay in the form of a governing token representing voting power, Vote-escrowed SOLACE token (veSOLACE).

The weight of an individual’s voting power will be determined not only by the lockup period - the longer the lockup period, the more veSOLACE will be received by the individual. Voters will also be able to delegate their votes to other individuals, however, veSOLACE tokens cannot be transferred.

The governance is performed utilizing a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) structure which consists of two layers: the community stakeholders and the management.

## Community Stakeholders

Community Stakeholders are holders of locked veSOLACE tokens. These stakeholders don't manage day-to-day operations of the Solace protocol but can vote on (and propose) all strategic decisions, including but not limited to adjusting tokenomics, incentives mechanisms, changes to the protocols architecture and/or design, and treasury expenditures on contributor grants, community initiatives, collaboration projects, and other programs. Initial governance parameters are as follows:
- 0.1% of veSOLACE total supply (or delegated) to submit a proposal.
- 33% of veSOLACE tokens are required to submit their vote to consider any
proposal valid.
- 51% of the voted vsSOLACE must vote ’yes’ to reach a quorum for any
decision.
- 14 day voting period.
- 3-day timelock delay on execution.

# Management

The management is the stewardship of the SOLACE Protocol. Members of the management team are responsible for day-to-day operation of the protocol, writing proposals, rolling out updates and upgrades to the platform, and other upkeeping duties. The management team is also responsible for any emergency response (e.g., pausing the contracts functionality). This team initially consists of the core team members building out Solace protocol. Once the governance structure is completely rolled out, community stakeholders will nominate people and vote to add them as acting management team members to help the protocol grow and perform the necessary duties.
