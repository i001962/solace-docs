## DAO-first capital formation

Pioneered by BarnBridge and Kain Warwick’s ideas, this crypto native approach offers a unique ability to run the project as a DAO from day 0 and quickly adjust to an ever-changing environment in DeFi. This setup entails that the project is financed and launched by a decentralized governance model. Splitting out the control gives every party an equitable vote as well as keeps us honest in front of each other and the community.

## DAO structure

At the moment we have launched Solace LaunchDAO, that acts as a coordination vehicle to deliver us to Solace DAO. This LaunchDAO holds the funds, $SOLACE tokens, is controlled by the Launch DAO tokens and primarily votes on high-level protocol decisions of significant importance.. The funds are released in a drip fashion over time to finance the development and growth and ultimately ensure transition into a formal community-run DAO structure.

## Transition to Community-run DAO in the Future

The purpose of this LaunchDAO is to bootstrap the development and allow for rapid scaling of Solace’s platform. Eventually we are going to reach the point where the governance can be handed off to the community and Solace can be a self-sustaining protocol. With that in mind, our job is to push the project forward, build a community around it, and create a system that will inherit the rule.

Starting October, we plan to allocate resources to the development of Solace DAO, so you can expect the transition to happen around the end of this year.
