# Coverage Products

Coverage products are a suite of smart contracts managed by a risk assessment model that allow users to purchase coverage policies. Each product provides policies for a single protocol, across all of its smart contracts that hold value, so the pricing and capacity is set on a by-protocol basis. Though a new version of a protocol requires a new product (e.g., Uniswap V2 versus Uniswap V3).

**Protocol and platform currently covered by Solace:**

- Aave
- Compound
- Liquity
- Yearn.Finance
- Uniswap V2
- Sushiswap

More protocol products are in the works by both Solace core team and independent risk managers. Please stay updated for new releases through Twitter and Discord.
