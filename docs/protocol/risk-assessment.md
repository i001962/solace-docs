# Risk Assessment

Solace built an architecture that facilitates and incentivises intelligent risk assessment, in a distributed manner. Anyone can develop his/her own risk models, deploy it and release coverage products. Then underwriters (i.e., capital providers) can evaluate the model and decide to allocate coverage capacity through voting to it. The capital pool underwrites the risk across a variety of risk assessment models that manage coverage products. People are incentivised to develop such models through a fee they earn from policy sales. Please check the *Become Risk Manager* guide for more information.

To launch the platform and scale up, Solace core contributors have developed the first risk assessment model based on statistics and probability delivering the first coverage products. Our main objective is to support others (both financially and technically) to develop new risk models and products.

Briefly:

- Risk managed through assessment models driven by a combination of quantitative and qualitative measures.

- Does not rely on voting, staking or market forces to determine the risk of an existing DeFi Platform.

- Architecture will allow anyone to deploy your own risk assessment model and become a risk manager.
