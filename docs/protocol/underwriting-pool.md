# Underwriting Pool

There is a single shared ETH pool backing the risks across all products (i.e., covered protocols).  Anyone can become a capital provider, back the coverage policies and vote on gauges to allocate coverage capacity for risk managers’ products. Premiums flow in the capital underwriting pool and are shared between capital providers (less a small fee to risk managers).

However, when we are just starting off our adventure, we open Options Farming Pool so capital providers can benefit while there is no significant returns from the premiums so far. Jump on *Options Farming Pool* section and find out more about it.

Short summary:

- Single ETH pool
- Backs all the coverage policies (entire risk portofolio)
- Underwriters vote on gauges to allocate coverage capacity
- Premiums flow directly into the underwriting pool
- Solace policies cover financial losses (within policy’s cover limit), so the underwriters are not liable for the entire covered amount or speculative coverages.
