# Pricing

Solace protocol has developed a pricing model which prices coverage products based
on the following variables:

- **General Ethereum smart contract risk factor**: Set by the Solace protocol and biases the premiums to ensure the platform charges a fair amount corresponding to security risks carried by all the DeFi protocols on Ethereum network leveraging the historical data and the security state of the ecosystem.
- **Products risk factor**: Set by the Solace protocol and adjusts the premiums based on individual DeFi smart contracts; riskier platforms will have a higher factor increasing the premium.
- **Chosen policy period and coverage limit:** allow the user to tune the premium according to their needs.

Solaceâ€™s pricing model follows a set of fundamentals. Pricing floors set for different DeFi products based on overall risk assessment. Once the risk floor is established, policyholders select the length of coverage and the coverage limit to tune their desired premium level. As the coverage limit decreases, premiums will also decrease, balancing out the risk. Solace manages pricing by viewing its coverage across protocols in aggregate (i.e., within its portfolio), leveraging guidance from the actuarial science: aggregate loss assessment. This allows Solace to provide superior pricing as it can balance its risk across its overall portfolio while recognizing and capitalizing on efficiencies brought with continued scale.

Solace is uniquely positioned to provide more efficient and fair pricing based on its risk assessment model. Where many protocols leverage staking (or voting) to determine pricing for coverage, Solace leverages its intelligent models to increase both accuracy and precision of the risk profile resulting in optimal premium pricing. Ultimately, this approach helps provide fairly priced coverage across a wide range of protocols, avoiding the comparative bias that comes with voting-based models (i.e., most people in the DeFi space base their security perception of a protocol compared to other protocols in their environment).
