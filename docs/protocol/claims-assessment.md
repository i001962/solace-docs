# Claims Assessment

Solace removes centralization and bureaucracy that comes with claims assessment committees and human-operated processes by introducing an automatic parametric claims assessment process. This program evaluates the financial losses carried in an unfortunate shortfall event and, if the claim is valid, submits the pay-out right away.

## Automatic Claims Pipelining

Solace protocol utilizes a parametric automated claims assessment (PACLAS) system to streamline the claims validation and pay-out process. Once a claim has been opened, users will see the outcome right away, without delay for reviews by any claims assessment committee. This approach removes any centralization and bureaucracy in the claims evaluation process and levels the ground for all policyholders.

## Claims Contesting

To ensure fair and democratic governance over the claims assessment, the automated decision can be contested by a policyholder on two levels. First, the contested claim is escalated to the evaluation by the management team (an escalation fee must be paid). Second, if the managements decision is contested further, the user can escalate the claim to the community stakeholder level (another fee payment is required) whose decision is final. Below is the description of a claim lifecycle:

1. A policyholder can submit a claim providing the incident information (e.g., timestamp, transaction hash, etc.), and specifying the amount of loss incurred.
2. The claims adjuster will evaluate the validity and the financial loss, and, if determined valid, will submit the pay-out transaction into the transaction pipeline. To avoid any critical vulnerabilities or errors on behalf of the automated system, all pay-out transactions will first enter a cooldown period before being delivered to the policyholder. This measure helps to stress test the system and give room for the community to interfere in case of an error.
3. Suppose the outcome is deemed unsatisfactory by the policyholder. In that case, they can contest and escalate the claim to the management (a fee must be paid), which will evaluate the claimâ€™s validity and make its judgment within three weeks. A similar process is followed for the subsequent escalation stage with the community stakeholders.
