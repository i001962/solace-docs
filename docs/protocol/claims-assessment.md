# Claims Assessment

Solace removes centralization and bureaucracy that comes with claims assessment committees and human-operated processes by introducing an automatic parametric claims assessment process. This program evaluates the financial losses carried in an unfortunate shortfall event and, if the claim is valid, submits the pay-out right away.

## Automatic Claims Pipelining

Solace protocol utilizes a parametric automated claims assessment (PACLAS) system to streamline the claims validation and pay-out process. Once a claim has been opened, users will see the outcome right away, without delay for reviews by any claims assessment committee. This approach removes any centralization and bureaucracy in the claims evaluation process and levels the ground for all policyholders.

First, the contested claim is escalated to the evaluation by the management team (an escalation fee must be paid). Second, if the managements decision is contested further, the user can escalate the claim to the community stakeholder level (another fee payment is required) whose decision is final. Below is the description of a claim lifecycle:
