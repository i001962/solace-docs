# Bonding

In order to incentivise DeFi users who are willing to provide capital in the underwriting pool or liquidity in SushiSwap liquidity pool, we use bonding, like OlympusDAOâ€™s mechanism, to buy and grow the underwriting capital and liquidity on the open market. This way allows Solace to align incentives with protocol long-term sustainability.

Users can buy $SOLACE with discount through bonds at https://solace.fi. Bonds can be purchased in a variety of assets including ETH, WBTC, USDC, DAI, USDT, SCP, and SOLACE-USDC SLP.

Bonds are vested over five days, after that users are able to redeem for $SOLACE. The price begins at $0.10/SOLACE, increases by $0.01/SOLACE for every 50,000 SOLACE bonded, and decreases over time until a new bond is purchased.

Note that these are accounted separately by asset, e.g. WBTC bond price will not be affected by ETH bond sales.
