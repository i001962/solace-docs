# Staking

Solace staking gives users an opportunity to unlock the governance rights and earn protocol’s revenue from the underwriting activity, as well as further $SOLACE distribution, while the risk of underwriting falls on the protocol’s owned pool.

The accrued policy premiums are collected and used to buy up SOLACE on the open market to then distribute to xSOLACE holders, and later other beneficiaries.

The xSOLACE staking contract is designed to be a safe up-only pool that allows users to enter or leave at any time, even when buying bonds.

Staking allows Protocol to drive the utility and establish demand on the $SOLACE token, which in turn helps the token to show stable growth.
