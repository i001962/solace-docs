# Coverage Policy

Coverage policy is a NFT (ERC-721) token that represents underwritersâ€™ obligation to pay out financial losses carried by the policyholders in the event of a technical failure or exploit. Below is a brief list of possible covered events. Please read *Terms & Conditions* for the full disclosure of what constitutes a covered event and refer to *Claims Assessment* and *Open a Claim* to learn more about the claims process and the mechanics behind it.

**Solace will provide coverage policies across following exploits types:**

- Minting vulnerability
- Flash loan attack
- Trojan fake token
- Proxy manipulation
- Math error
- Re-entry attack

**Does not provide for:**

- Price arbitrage
- Compromised private keys
- Phishing attack

Solace only pays out financial loss (within coverage limit) and not the overall position covered by the end customer.
