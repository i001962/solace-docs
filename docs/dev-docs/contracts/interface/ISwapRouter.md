Functions for swapping tokens via Uniswap V3




### `exactInputSingle(struct ISwapRouter.ExactInputSingleParams params) → uint256 amountOut` (external)

Swaps `amountIn` of one token for as much as possible of another token




### `exactInput(struct ISwapRouter.ExactInputParams params) → uint256 amountOut` (external)

Swaps `amountIn` of one token for as much as possible of another along the specified path




### `exactOutputSingle(struct ISwapRouter.ExactOutputSingleParams params) → uint256 amountIn` (external)

Swaps as little as possible of one token for `amountOut` of another token




### `exactOutput(struct ISwapRouter.ExactOutputParams params) → uint256 amountIn` (external)

Swaps as little as possible of one token for `amountOut` of another along the specified path (reversed)
