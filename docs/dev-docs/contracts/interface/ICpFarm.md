Rewards [**Capital Providers**](/docs/user-guides/capital-provider/cp-role-guide) in [**SOLACE**](../SOLACE) for providing capital in the [`Vault`](../Vault).

Over the course of `startTime` to `endTime`, the farm distributes `rewardPerSecond` [**SOLACE**](../SOLACE) to all farmers split relative to the amount of [**SCP**](../Vault) they have deposited.

Users can become [**Capital Providers**](/docs/user-guides/capital-provider/cp-role-guide) by depositing **ETH** into the [`Vault`](../Vault), receiving [**SCP**](../Vault) in the process. [**Capital Providers**](/docs/user-guides/capital-provider/cp-role-guide) can then deposit their [**SCP**](../Vault) via [`depositCp()`](#depositcp) or [`depositCpSigned()`](#depositcpsigned). Alternatively users can bypass the [`Vault`](../Vault) and stake their **ETH** via [`depositEth()`](#depositeth).

Users can withdraw their rewards via [`withdrawRewards()`](#withdrawrewards).

Users can withdraw their [**SCP**](../Vault) via [`withdrawCp()`](#withdrawcp).

Note that transferring in **ETH** will mint you shares, but transferring in **WETH** or [**SCP**](../Vault) will not. These must be deposited via functions in this contract. Misplaced funds cannot be rescued.
