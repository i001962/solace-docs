# Capital Providers

On the Solace Protocol, you provide funds to back the platform's risks when it sells coverage to Policy Holders, all while earning you rewards in doing so.

As a Capital Provider, you have two pools to interact with: the Risk-backing Capital Pool and the Capital Provider Pool.

## Providing Funds

You will provide funds by depositing into the Risk-backing Capital Pool, and in exchange you receive Capital Provider (CP) tokens in your wallet. You can then deposit these CP tokens into the Capital Provider Pool to generate rewards.

## Withdrawing Funds

Please be aware that there is a lock-up period of 7 days that you must wait through before withdrawing your funds from the Risk-backing Capital Pool. Also, if the time you've waited surpasses 35 days, your funds cannot be withdrawn and you will need to restart the lock-up period. The purpose of this lock-up mechanism is to prevent system exploits and abuse.

To withdraw your funds from Solace, the scenario depends on what you do with your CP tokens. If you have deposited those tokens into the Capital Provider Pool, simply withdraw them, then continue to withdraw from the Risk-backing Capital Pool. If the CP tokens are on your wallet, just withdraw from the Risk-backing Capital Pool.
