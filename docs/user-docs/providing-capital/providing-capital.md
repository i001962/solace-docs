## Withdrawing Funds

To withdraw your funds from Solace, the scenario depends on what you do with your CP tokens. If you have deposited those tokens into the Capital Provider Pool, simply withdraw them, then continue to withdraw from the Risk-backing Capital Pool. If the CP tokens are on your wallet, just withdraw from the Risk-backing Capital Pool.

Please be aware that there is a **lock-up period** of 7 days that you must wait through before withdrawing your funds from the Risk-backing Capital Pool. Also, if the time you've waited surpasses 35 days, your funds cannot be withdrawn and you will need to restart the lock-up period. The purpose of this lock-up mechanism is to prevent system exploits and abuse.
