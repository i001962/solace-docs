# Liquidity Mining

A guide to start mining liquidity

#### Step 1: Provide Liquidity

If you have gotten Liquidity Provider tokens already, skip to step 2, else add liquidity first.

- ##### Start providing liquidity for SOLACE on a decentralized exchange or market maker. Afterwards, check that you have received Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens in your wallet. 

#### Step 2: Navigate to the **Invest** page.

#### Step 3: Find the **Liquidity Provider** Farm

- #### **Deposit Button**: Providing Liquidity

    - ##### Deposit these LP tokens into the Liquidity Provider Pool on Solace to generate rewards.

- #### **Withdraw Button**: Removing liquidity

    - ##### You may withdraw your LP tokens from the Liquidity Provider Pool at any time.

## Why can't I deposit or withdraw a specific amount?

Unlike some protocols that allow you to deposit or withdraw a specific percentage of your LP tokens, here at Solace, you will not working with ERC20 tokens, but with ERC721 tokens. In other words, you can only deposit or withdraw whole LP tokens.
