# Liquidity Providers

On the Solace Protocol, you provide liquidity that would attract capital and distribute SOLACE to investors in the protocol.

As a liquidity Provider, you interact with the Liquidity Provider Pool.

## Providing Liquidity

You can provide liquidity for SOLACE on a decentralized exchange or market maker. After you do that, you should receive a Liquidity Provider (LP) token(s). You can then deposit these LP tokens into the Liquidity Provider Pool on Solace to generate rewards.

## Withdrawing Funds

You may withdraw your LP tokens from the Liquidity Provider Pool at any time.

## Why can't I deposit or withdraw a specific amount?

Unlike some protocols that allow you to deposit or withdraw a specific percentage of your LP tokens, here at Solace, you deposit or withdraw whole LP Tokens. In other words, you will not working with ERC20 tokens, but with ERC721 tokens.
